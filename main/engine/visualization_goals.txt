1. Overall Visualization Goal: How well does the result use volume rendering to clearly present the internal and external structures of the engine dataset?

2. Structural Clarity: Does the visualization emphasize depth so that the outer layers do not obscure the inner structures?

3. Transfer Function Transparency: Is the outer region rendered with higher transparency and the inner region more solid, achieving a clear layering effect?

4. Transfer Function Color Mapping: Are colors correctly assigned so that the outer part is light blue and the inner part is orange, enhancing structural contrast?
