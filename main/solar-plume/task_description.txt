Task:

Load the tornado dataset from "solar-plume/data/solar-plume_126x126x512_float32_scalar3.raw", the information about this dataset:
solar-plume (Vector)
Data Scalar Type: float
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Extent: 126x126x512
Number of Scalar Components: 3
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Add a “stream tracer” filter under the tornado data to display streamline, set the "Seed type" to "Point Cloud" and set the center of point cloud to 3D position [50, 50, 320] with a radius 30, then hide the point cloud sphere.

Add a "tube" filter under the "stream tracer" filter to enhance the streamline visualization. Set the radius to 0.5. In the pipeline browser panel, hide everything except the "tube" filter. 


Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "solar-plume/results/{agent_mode}/solar-plume.pvsm"
