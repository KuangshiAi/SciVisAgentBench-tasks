Task:

Load the carp dataset from "carp/data/carp_256x256x512_uint16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Carp (Scalar)
Data Scalar Type: unsigned short
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.78125x0.390625x1
Data Extent: 256x256x512

Instructions:

1. Load the dataset into ParaView.

2. Apply volume rendering to visualize the carp skeleton.

3. Adjust the transfer function to highlight only the bony structures in an X-ray style (suppressing soft tissue).

4. Optimize the viewpoint to display the full skeleton, ensuring the head, spine, and fins are all clearly visible in a single frame.

5. Analyze the visualization and answer the following questions:
Q1: How many distinct fins are visible in the carp skeleton? List their anatomical names and corresponding counts.
Q2: Estimate the ratio of skull length to overall body length, based on the visualization.

6. Save your work:
Save the ParaView state as "carp/results/{agent_mode}/carp.pvsm".
Save the answers to the analysis questions in plain text as "carp/results/{agent_mode}/answers.txt".
