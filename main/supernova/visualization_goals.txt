1. Overall Visualization Goal: How well does the result achieve the overall goal of showing the supernova structure with two distinct isosurfaces representing different density regions?

2. Does the red isosurface show low density areas (outside regions) with lower opacity?

3. Does the blue isosurface show high density areas (inside regions) with higher opacity?
