Task:

Load the vortex dataset from "vortex/data/vortex_128x128x128_float32.raw", the information about this dataset:
vortex (Scalar)
Data Scalar Type: float
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Extent: 128x128x128
Number of Scalar Components: 1

Instructions:

1. Load the dataset into ParaView.

2. Leverage "contour" filter to achieve iso-surface rendering. In pipeline browser panel, hide everything except the "contour" fileter.

3. In properties panel of "contour" filter, set isosurface value to -0.2, use Solid Color and set the color as beige.

4. Enable Ambient occlusion by toggle the "Use Ambient Occlusion" button in the Render Passes.

5. Add head light with light inspector, set "Coords" as Camera, "Intentsity" to 0.2, Type to "Directional".

6. Save your work:
Save the ParaView state as "vortex/results/{agent_mode}/vortex.pvsm".
