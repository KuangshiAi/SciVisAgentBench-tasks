# Scientific Visualization Task Taxonomy for Spatial and Volumetric Data

## Executive Summary

Scientific visualization differs fundamentally from information visualization in its focus on **spatial data inherent to physical phenomena**. While information visualization deals with abstract data requiring spatial mappings, scientific visualization works with data that has intrinsic 3D/4D spatial structure - from molecular dynamics simulations to atmospheric models.

## Conclusion

Scientific visualization tasks form a rich hierarchy from low-level geometric operations to high-level scientific discovery. Unlike information visualization's focus on abstract data mapping, scientific visualization must preserve and reveal the inherent spatial structure of physical phenomena. The unique challenges include:

1. **Continuous-to-discrete**: Sampling and reconstruction issues
2. **3D occlusion**: Need for cutting, transparency, and focus+context
3. **Multi-scale phenomena**: Features at vastly different scales
4. **Temporal evolution**: 4D data with complex dynamics
5. **Computational intensity**: Massive datasets requiring parallel processing

Success in scientific visualization requires careful orchestration of these tasks, from efficient low-level algorithms for volume rendering and isosurface extraction, through robust feature detection methods, to high-level scientific interpretation and validation. The field continues to evolve with advances in GPU computing, machine learning-assisted feature detection, and immersive visualization technologies, but the fundamental task taxonomy remains grounded in extracting meaningful structures from spatial scientific data.
