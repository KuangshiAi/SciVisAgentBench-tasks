Task:

Load the Leg of Statue dataset from "statue_leg/data/statue_leg_341x341x93_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
Leg of Statue
Description: CT scan of a leg of a bronze statue.
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x4
Data Extent: 341x341x93
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "statue_leg/results/statue_leg.pvsm"
