Task:

Load the Backpack Scan dataset from "backpack/data/backpack_512x512x373_uint16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Backpack Scan
Description: CT scan of a backpack filled with items.
Data Type: uint16
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.9766x0.9766x1.25
Data Extent: 512x512x373
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "backpack/results/backpack.pvsm"
