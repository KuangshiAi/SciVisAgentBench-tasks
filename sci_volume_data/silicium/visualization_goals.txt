1. Overall Visualization Goal: How well does the result show the flow patterns or simulation dynamics in the Silicium dataset?

2. Does the volume rendering effectively show the data distribution and gradients?

3. Are flow features (vortices, boundaries, etc.) clearly visible?

4. Is the color map appropriate for the physical quantity being visualized?
