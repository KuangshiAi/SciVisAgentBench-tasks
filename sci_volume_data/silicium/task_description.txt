Task:

Load the Silicium dataset from "silicium/data/silicium_98x34x34_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
Silicium
Description: Simulation of a silicium grid.
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x1
Data Extent: 98x34x34
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize the flow field. Apply volume rendering with a suitable color map to show the data distribution. Add streamlines or vectors if vector data is available.

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "silicium/results/silicium.pvsm"
