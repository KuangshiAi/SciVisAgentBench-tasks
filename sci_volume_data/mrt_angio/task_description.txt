Task:

Load the Head MRT Angiography dataset from "mrt_angio/data/mrt_angio_416x512x112_uint16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Head MRT Angiography
Description: 3T MRT Time-of-Flight Angiography dataset of a human head. The dataset has been resampled into an isotropic voxel grid (hence the peculiar slice size).
Data Type: uint16
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.412x0.412x0.412
Data Extent: 416x512x112
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it using appropriate techniques:
1. Apply volume rendering with a suitable transfer function to reveal internal structures
2. Extract at least one meaningful isosurface
3. Choose appropriate colors and opacity values for clarity

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "mrt_angio/results/mrt_angio.pvsm"
