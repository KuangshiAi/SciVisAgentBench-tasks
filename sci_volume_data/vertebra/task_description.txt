Task:

Load the Head Aneurism dataset from "vertebra/data/vertebra_512x512x512_uint16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Head Aneurism
Description: Rotational angiography scan of a head with an aneurysm. Only contrasted blood vessels are visible.
Data Type: uint16
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.1953x0.1953x0.1953
Data Extent: 512x512x512
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "vertebra/results/vertebra.pvsm"
