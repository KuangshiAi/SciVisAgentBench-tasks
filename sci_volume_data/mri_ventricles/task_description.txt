Task:

Load the Head MRI CISS dataset from "mri_ventricles/data/mri_ventricles_256x256x124_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
Head MRI CISS
Description: 1.5T MRT 3D CISS dataset of a human head that highlights the CSF (Cerebro-Spinal-Fluid) filled cavities of the head.
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.9x0.9x0.9
Data Extent: 256x256x124
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize the flow field. Apply volume rendering with a suitable color map to show the data distribution. Add streamlines or vectors if vector data is available.

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "mri_ventricles/results/mri_ventricles.pvsm"
