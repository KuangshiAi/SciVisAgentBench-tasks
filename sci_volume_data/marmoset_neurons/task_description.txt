Task:

Load the Neurons in Marmoset Visual Cortex dataset from "marmoset_neurons/data/marmoset_neurons_1024x1024x314_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
Neurons in Marmoset Visual Cortex
Description: Pyramidal neurons in the marmoset primary visual cortex (V1) labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) after injection of a psuedotyped G-deleted rabies virus in area V2. The tissue was cleared using the Sca/e technique and imaged on a Olympus 2-photon microscope at 20x magnification.
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.497x0.497x1.5
Data Extent: 1024x1024x314
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "marmoset_neurons/results/marmoset_neurons.pvsm"
