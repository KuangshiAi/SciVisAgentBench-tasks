Task:

Load the Lobster dataset from "lobster/data/lobster_301x324x56_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
Lobster
Description: CT scan of a lobster contained in a block of resin.
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x1.4
Data Extent: 301x324x56
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "lobster/results/lobster.pvsm"
