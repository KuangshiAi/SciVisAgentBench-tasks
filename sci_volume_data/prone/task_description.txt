Task:

Load the Colon Prone dataset from "prone/data/prone_512x512x463_uint16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Colon Prone
Description: CT scan of abdomen in prone orientation (back faces ceiling, belly faces table).
Data Type: uint16
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.625x0.625x1.0
Data Extent: 512x512x463
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "prone/results/prone.pvsm"
