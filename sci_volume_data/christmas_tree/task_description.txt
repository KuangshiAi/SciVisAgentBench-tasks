Task:

Load the Christmas Tree dataset from "christmas_tree/data/christmas_tree_512x499x512_uint16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Christmas Tree
Description: The Christmas tree model was scanned with a Siemens Somatom Plus 4 Volume Zoom Multislice-CT scanner at the general hospital in Vienna.
Data Type: uint16
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x1
Data Extent: 512x499x512
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "christmas_tree/results/christmas_tree.pvsm"
