Task:

Load the Carp dataset from "carp/data/carp_256x256x512_uint16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Carp
Description: CT scan of a carp fish
Data Type: uint16
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.78125x0.390625x1
Data Extent: 256x256x512
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "carp/results/carp.pvsm"
