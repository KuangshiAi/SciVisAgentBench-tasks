Task:

Load the Nucleon dataset from "nucleon/data/nucleon_41x41x41_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
Nucleon
Description: Simulation of the two-body distribution probability of a nucleon in the atomic nucleus 16O if a second nucleon is known to be positioned at r'=(2 fm,0,0).
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x1
Data Extent: 41x41x41
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize the flow field. Apply volume rendering with a suitable color map to show the data distribution. Add streamlines or vectors if vector data is available.

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "nucleon/results/nucleon.pvsm"
