Task:

Load the Stented Abdominal Aorta dataset from "stent/data/stent_512x512x174_uint16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Stented Abdominal Aorta
Description: CT Scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The dataset contains also a stent in the abdominal aorta. No contrast agent was used to enhance the blood vessels.
Data Type: uint16
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.8398x0.8398x3.2
Data Extent: 512x512x174
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "stent/results/stent.pvsm"
