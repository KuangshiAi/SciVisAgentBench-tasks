Task:

Load the Boston Teapot dataset from "boston_teapot/data/boston_teapot_256x256x178_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
Boston Teapot
Description: CT scan of the SIGGRAPH 1989 teapot with a small version of the AVS lobster inside.
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x1
Data Extent: 256x256x178
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "boston_teapot/results/boston_teapot.pvsm"
