Task:

Load the Duct Flow dataset from "duct/data/duct_193x194x1000_float32.raw", the information about this dataset:
Duct Flow
Description: A wall-bounded flow in a duct.
Data Type: float32
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x1
Data Extent: 193x194x1000
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "duct/results/duct.pvsm"
