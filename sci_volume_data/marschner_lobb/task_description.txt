Task:

Load the Marschner-Lobb dataset from "marschner_lobb/data/marschner_lobb_41x41x41_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
Marschner-Lobb
Description: High frequencies where 99% of the sinusoids are right below the Nyquist frequency.
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x1
Data Extent: 41x41x41
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it using appropriate techniques:
1. Apply volume rendering with a suitable transfer function to reveal internal structures
2. Extract at least one meaningful isosurface
3. Choose appropriate colors and opacity values for clarity

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "marschner_lobb/results/marschner_lobb.pvsm"
