Task:

Load the Neocortical Layer 1 Axons dataset from "neocortical_layer_1_axons/data/neocortical_layer_1_axons_1464x1033x76_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
Neocortical Layer 1 Axons
Description: Axons in layer 1 of the mouse barrel cortex imaged in vivo.
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x3.4
Data Extent: 1464x1033x76
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it using appropriate techniques:
1. Apply volume rendering with a suitable transfer function to reveal internal structures
2. Extract at least one meaningful isosurface
3. Choose appropriate colors and opacity values for clarity

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "neocortical_layer_1_axons/results/neocortical_layer_1_axons.pvsm"
