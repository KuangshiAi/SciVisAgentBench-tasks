Task:

Load the CSAFE Heptane Gas dataset from "csafe_heptane/data/csafe_heptane_302x302x302_uint8.raw", the information about this dataset:
CSAFE Heptane Gas
Description: A single time step from a computational simulation of a jet of heptane gas undergoing combustion.
Data Type: uint8
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1x1x1
Data Extent: 302x302x302
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize the flow field. Apply volume rendering with a suitable color map to show the data distribution. Add streamlines or vectors if vector data is available.

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "csafe_heptane/results/csafe_heptane.pvsm"
