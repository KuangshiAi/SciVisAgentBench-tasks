Task:

Load the Pancreas dataset from "pancreas/data/pancreas_240x512x512_int16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Pancreas
Description: First scan. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center performed 82 abdominal contrast enhanced 3D CT scans (~70 seconds after intravenous contrast injection in portal-venous) from 53 male and 27 female subjects. Seventeen of the subjects are healthy kidney donors scanned prior to nephrectomy. The remaining 65 patients were selected by a radiologist from patients who neither had major abdominal pathologies nor pancreatic cancer lesions. Subjects' ages range from 18 to 76 years with a mean age of 46.8 Â± 16.7. The CT scans have resolutions of 512x512 pixels with varying pixel sizes and slice thickness between 1.5 - 2.5 mm, acquired on Philips and Siemens MDCT scanners (120 kVp tube voltage). A medical student manually performed slice-by-slice segmentations of the pancreas as ground-truth and these were verified/modified by an experienced radiologist.
Data Type: int16
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 1.16x1.0x1.0
Data Extent: 240x512x512
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "pancreas/results/pancreas.pvsm"
