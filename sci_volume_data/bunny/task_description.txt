Task:

Load the Bunny dataset from "bunny/data/bunny_512x512x361_uint16.raw", the information about this dataset:
Bunny
Description: A CT scan of the Stanford Bunny. The greyscale units are Hounsfield units, denoting electron-density of the subject; the scale units are in millimeters. The scan was completed 28 January 2000.
Data Type: uint16
Data Byte Order: little Endian
Data Spacing: 0.337891x0.337891x0.5
Data Extent: 512x512x361
Data loading is very important, make sure you correctly load the dataset according to their features.

Then visualize it and extract isosurfaces to reveal the internal structures. Create one isosurface for soft tissue (lower isovalue, color: red, opacity: 0.3) and another for bone/dense structures (higher isovalue, color: white, opacity: 0.8).

Please think step by step and make sure to fulfill all the visualization goals mentioned above.

Finally, save the paraview state as "bunny/results/bunny.pvsm"
