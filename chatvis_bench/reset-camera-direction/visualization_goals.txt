1. Wavelet Creation: Is the Wavelet object properly created and displayed in the scene?

2. Surface with Edges Representation: Is the wavelet correctly displayed with "Surface with Edges" representation showing both surface and wireframe?

3. Camera Direction: Is the camera positioned according to the specified direction vector [0.5, 1, 0.5]?

4. View Quality: Does the visualization provide a clear view of the wavelet structure from the specified camera angle?
