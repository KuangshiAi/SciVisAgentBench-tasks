Read in the file named "ml-slice-iso/data/ml-slice-iso.vtk", slice the volume with a y-z plane at x=0, and take a contour, colored red, through the slice at the value 0.5.
Save a screenshot of a +x direction view, size 1920 x 1080 pixels, of the result in "ml-slice-iso/results/{agent_mode}/ml-slice-iso.png".
Finally, save the ParaView state as "ml-slice-iso/results/{agent_mode}/ml-slice-iso.pvsm"
