1. Isosurface Generation: Is the isosurface properly generated at the specified value (0.5) with correct topology and continuity?

2. Surface Rendering Quality: Does the isosurface display smooth surfaces with appropriate shading and lighting that reveals the 3D structure?

3. Geometric Accuracy: Are the surface features geometrically correct and free from artifacts or discontinuities?

4. Visual Presentation: Is the isosurface clearly visible with good contrast and coloring that enhances the understanding of the data structure?
