Read in the file named "climate/data/climate.vtp".
Apply a calculator filter to convert velocity from geospatial to lat-long coordinates.
Render the computed values using a tube filter with 0.05 radius, colored by velocity magnitude, and lit with maximum shininess and include normals for lighting.
Add cone glyphs to show the direction of the velocity, using 10 polygons, radius 0.15, height 0.5, and scaling factor 0.5.
View the result in the -z direction scaled so that the tubes occupy most of the image.
Save a screenshot of the result, 2294 x 1440 pixels, white background, in the filename "climate/results/{agent_mode}/climate.png".
Finally, save the ParaView state as "climate/results/{agent_mode}/climate.pvsm"
