Read in the file named "stream-glyph/data/stream-glyph.ex2", and trace streamlines of the V variable seeded from a default point cloud.
Render the streamlines with tubes, adding cone glyphs to the streamlines, and coloring the streamlines and glyphs by the Temp variable.
Save a screenshot of a +x view of the result, size 1920 x 1080 pixels, in "stream-glyph/results/{agent_mode}/stream-glyph.png".
Finally, save the ParaView state as "stream-glyph/results/{agent_mode}/stream-glyph.pvsm"
