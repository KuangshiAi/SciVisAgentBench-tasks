1. Sphere Creation and Resolution: Is the sphere created with doubled theta resolution providing higher geometric detail and smoother curvature?

2. Shrink Filter Application: Is the shrink filter properly applied with halved shrink factor creating visible separation between mesh elements?

3. Dual Representation: Are both the wireframe sphere and shrink filter results simultaneously visible and properly grouped together?

4. Visual Quality: Does the visualization clearly show the contrast between the wireframe structure and the shrunken elements with appropriate white background?
