Compare two datasets in two views side by side each 900 pixels wide x 1400 pixels high.
Read the dataset "materials/data/materials_prediction.vtr" in the left view and "materials/data/materials_ground_truth.vtr" in the right view.
In both views, convert the "Intensity" and "Phase" variables from cell to point data.
In both views, take an isovolume of the "Intensity" variable in the range of [0.2, 1.0], clipped with a plane at (32.0, 32.0, 32.0) and +x normal direction.
Color both views with the Viridis (matplotlib) color map for the "Phase" variable, scaled to the data range, including a colormap legend in both views.
Label the left view "NN Prediction" and the right view "Ground Truth".
Orient the camera to look in the (-1, 0, -1) direction, with the datasets fitting in the views.
Save a screenshot of both views in "materials/results/{agent_mode}/materials.png".
Finally, save the ParaView state as "materials/results/{agent_mode}/materials.pvsm"
