1. Wavelet Visualization: Is the wavelet object properly rendered with RTDATA coloring and visible color bar?

2. Split View Layout: Is the view correctly split with the wavelet visualization on the left and histogram on the right?

3. Histogram Generation: Is the histogram properly generated from RTDATA showing the data distribution?

4. Color Map Consistency: Are both the wavelet visualization and histogram using the same Cool to Warm color map?
