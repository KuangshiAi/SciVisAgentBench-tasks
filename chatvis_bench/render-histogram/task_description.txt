Create a wavelet object.
Render the RTDATA data in the wavelet and show the color bar.
[optional: Make sure the colors are rescaled to the data range]
[optional: Use the color map called 'Cool to Warm']

Next, split the view to the right and create a histogram from RTDATA.
Use the same color map as before.
Save a screenshot of the line chart in the file "render-histogram/results/{agent_mode}/render-histogram.png".
Finally, save the ParaView state as "render-histogram/results/{agent_mode}/render-histogram.pvsm"
