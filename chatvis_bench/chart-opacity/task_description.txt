Create a wavelet object.
Create a plot over line chart from the wavelet with three paths: arc_length, Points_Z, and RTData variables with opacity for arc_length 1 and opacity for Points_Z and RTData 0.3.
Save a screenshot in "chart-opacity/results/{agent_mode}/chart-opacity.png".
Finally, save the ParaView state as "chart-opacity/results/{agent_mode}/chart-opacity.pvsm"
