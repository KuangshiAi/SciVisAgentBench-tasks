Read the dataset in the file "time-varying/data/time-varying.ex2", and color the data by the EQPS variable.
Viewing in the +y direction, play an animation through the time steps, with visible color bar legend.
Rescale the data range to last time step, and play the animation again.
Create a second linked render view to the right of the first, applying a temporal interpolator to the second view.
Play the animation simultaneously in both views, and save the animation of both views in "time-varying/results/{agent_mode}/time-varying.avi".
Print the following statistics: average value of EQPS over all locations and all time steps, average value of EQPS over all locations in the first half of the time steps, average value of EQPS over all locations in the even numbered time steps, and variance of EQPS over all locations and all the time steps.
Finally, save the ParaView state as "time-varying/results/{agent_mode}/time-varying.pvsm"
