Read in the file named "points-surf-clip/data/points-surf-clip.ex2", generate a 3D Delaunay triangulation of the dataset, and clip with a y-z plane at x=0, keeping the -x half of the data.
Save a screenshot of the result as a wireframe, image size 1920 x 1080 pixels, in "points-surf-clip/results/{agent_mode}/points-surf-clip.png".
Finally, save the ParaView state as "points-surf-clip/results/{agent_mode}/points-surf-clip.pvsm"
