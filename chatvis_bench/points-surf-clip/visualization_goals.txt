1. Delaunay Triangulation Quality: Is the 3D Delaunay triangulation properly generated creating a valid mesh structure from the point data?

2. Clipping Accuracy: Is the mesh correctly clipped by the y-z plane at x=0, with only the -x half of the data remaining visible?

3. Wireframe Representation: Is the result displayed as a clear wireframe showing the triangulated mesh structure with visible edges?

4. Geometric Integrity: Does the clipped wireframe maintain proper connectivity and show the expected geometric features without artifacts?
